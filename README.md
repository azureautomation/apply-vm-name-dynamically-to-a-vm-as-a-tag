Apply VM name dynamically to a VM as a tag
==========================================

            

This workflow is designed to apply the VM name as a tag to all Azure VMs under your subscription, it basically loops all resource groups in the subscription after you successfully login with your credentials, then loops across all VMs and applies it with
 the $TagName you mapped earlier. This script needs proper azure login credential


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
